// Package billingconductor provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for AWSBillingConductor.
//
// Billing Conductor is a fully managed service that you can use to customize a [pro forma]
// version of your billing data each month, to accurately show or chargeback your
// end customers. Billing Conductor doesn't change the way you're billed by Amazon
// Web Services each month by design. Instead, it provides you with a mechanism to
// configure, generate, and display rates to certain customers over a given billing
// period. You can also analyze the difference between the rates you apply to your
// accounting groupings relative to your actual rates from Amazon Web Services. As
// a result of your Billing Conductor configuration, the payer account can also see
// the custom rate applied on the billing details page of the [Billing console], or configure a
// cost and usage report per billing group.
//
// This documentation shows how you can configure Billing Conductor by using its
// API. For more information about using the [Billing Conductor]user interface, see the [Billing Conductor User Guide].
