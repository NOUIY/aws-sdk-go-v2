	Bucket *string

	// The key of the dataset contents object in an S3 bucket. Each object has a key
	// that is a unique identifier. Each object has exactly one key.
	//
	// You can create a unique key with the following options:
	//
	//   - Use !{iotanalytics:scheduleTime} to insert the time of a scheduled SQL query
	//   run.
	//
	//   - Use !{iotanalytics:versionId} to insert a unique hash that identifies a
	//   dataset content.
	//
	//   - Use !{iotanalytics:creationTime} to insert the creation time of a dataset
	//   content.
	//
	// The following example creates a unique key for a CSV file:
	// dataset/mydataset/!{iotanalytics:scheduleTime}/!{iotanalytics:versionId}.csv
	//
	// If you don't use !{iotanalytics:versionId} to specify the key, you might get
	// duplicate keys. For example, you might have two dataset contents with the same
	// scheduleTime but different versionId s. This means that one dataset content
	// overwrites the other.
