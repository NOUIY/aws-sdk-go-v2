// Package rtbfabric provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// RTBFabric.
//
// Amazon Web Services RTB Fabric provides secure, low-latency infrastructure for
// connecting real-time bidding (RTB) applications. Rather than hosting
// applications directly, RTB Fabric acts as the connecting fabric that enables
// your applications to communicate efficiently over private networks instead of
// the public internet. You maintain complete control over your applications, data,
// and bidding decisions, while RTB Fabric provides the underlying infrastructure
// for secure, reliable connectivity.
//
// You can use these APIs to complete RTB Fabric tasks, such as setting up audit
// log ingestions or viewing user access. For more information about RTB Fabric,
// including the required permissions to use the service, see the [Amazon Web Services RTB Fabric User Guide].
